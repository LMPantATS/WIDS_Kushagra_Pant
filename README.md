Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — WiDS Project Summary

During the WiDS (Winter in Data Science) program, I developed a structured approach to Exploratory Data Analysis, progressing from basic univariate inspection to
question-driven multivariate analysis.

In the early phase, I focused on understanding distributions, missing values, and data quality issues, learning to avoid common mistakes such as over-cleaning, plotting 
without intent, and blindly trusting correlations. I learned to treat outliers as signals to investigate, not points to remove by default.

As the sessions progressed, the emphasis shifted to bivariate and conditional analysis, where I learned to ask meaningful pairwise questions instead of correlating variables 
mechanically. This included studying seasonality, contextual dependencies, and subgroup behavior.

The final AQI project applied these principles to real air-quality data. I analyzed seasonal pollutant behavior, compared extreme vs normal AQI days, and examined howdifferent
pollutants dominate AQI under different conditions. Rather than building a predictive model, the goal was to extract interpretable insights and generate better,testable 
questions for downstream modeling.

Overall, this project reflects a transition from plotting data to thinking analytically with data, using EDA as a tool for reasoning rather than decoration.
